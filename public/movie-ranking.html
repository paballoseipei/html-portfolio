<h1>The best movies according to Paballo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Scent of a woman</h3>
<p>Starred by one of the most brilliant actors of all time, Al Panico.<br />
    His acting of a blind retired Colonel is the best I have ever witnessed. <br /> 
</p>
<h3>The curious case of Benjamin Button</h3>
<p>One of the most brilliant reverse aging movies I have ever seen <br />
The main character, Benjamin is born with a rare condition of aging in reverse. Instead of growing old,<br />
 he grows young and yes he was born an old man.<br />
</p>
<h3>The talking of Pelham 123</h3>
<p>The main character in the movie is one of my favourite people, Denzel Washington, alongside John Travolta.<br />
Blue played by John is the villian who hijacks Garber acted by Denzel to bring money to him from one of the trains he dispatches. <br />
